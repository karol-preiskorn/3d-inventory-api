# Admin Account Locked - Password Reset Fix

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Issue:** Unable to login as admin - 401 Unauthorized "Invalid credentials"
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## Problem Description

User was unable to login to the UI as admin with credentials `admin` / `admin123!`, receiving:

```
XHRPOST https://d-inventory-api-wzwe3odv7q-ew.a.run.app/login
[HTTP/3 401  1139ms]

Request: {"username":"admin","password":"admin123!"}
Response: {"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Invalid credentials"}
```

### Root Causes

There were **TWO separate issues**:

#### 1. Admin Account Was Locked (Account Lockout Security Feature)

- After multiple failed login attempts, the admin account was automatically locked
- Lock duration: 15 minutes after 5+ failed attempts
- Account had 12 failed attempts and was locked until 2025-10-09T10:12:53.950Z

#### 2. Password in Database Was Incorrect

- The password stored in MongoDB did NOT match `admin123!`
- Previous password hash was invalid or corrupted
- This is why authentication kept failing even with correct credentials

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Admin Unlock Script

**File:** `/unlock-admin.ts`

This script:

- Connects directly to MongoDB Atlas
- Finds the admin user
- Displays current lock status and failed attempt count
- Resets `loginAttempts` to 0
- Removes `lockUntil` date
- Unlocks the account immediately

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run unlock:admin
```

**Output:**

```
🔓 Unlocking Admin Account
===========================
✅ Admin user found:
   - Username: admin
   - Role: admin
   - Email: karol@ultimasolution.pl
   - Login attempts: 12
   - Lock until: 2025-10-09T10:12:53.950Z
   - Currently locked: 🔒 YES
   - Time remaining: 8 minutes

🔓 Unlocking admin account...
✅ Admin account unlocked successfully!
   - Login attempts reset to 0
   - Lock removed

🎉 You can now login with: admin / admin123!
```

### 2. Created Password Reset Script

**File:** `/reset-admin-password.ts`

This script:

- Connects to MongoDB Atlas
- Hashes the password `admin123!` using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- Updates the admin user's password in the database
- Resets login attempts to 0
- Removes account lock
- Verifies the new password works

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run reset:admin-password
```

**Output:**

```
🔑 Resetting Admin Password
============================
✅ Admin user found:
   - Username: admin
   - Role: admin
   - Email: karol@ultimasolution.pl

🔑 Hashing new password: admin123!
💾 Updating password in database...
✅ Admin password reset successfully!
   - Password: admin123!
   - Login attempts reset to 0
   - Account unlocked

🔍 Verifying new password...
✅ Password verification SUCCESSFUL
```

### 3. Updated package.json Scripts

**File:** `/package.json`

Added two new NPM scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "unlock:admin": "npx tsx unlock-admin.ts",
    "reset:admin-password": "npx tsx reset-admin-password.ts"
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

### Before Fix

```bash
npm run test:db-auth
```

**Result:**

```
Testing: admin...
⚠️  Account admin is LOCKED: Account is locked. Try again in 13 minutes.
❌ Authentication FAILED for admin - Password incorrect
```

### After Fix

```bash
npm run reset:admin-password
npm run test:db-auth
```

**Result:**

```
Testing: admin...
✅ User admin exists in database
   - Role: admin
   - Active: true
   - Email: karol@ultimasolution.pl
✅ Authentication SUCCESS for admin
```

## Admin Credentials (Confirmed Working)

**Username:** `admin`
**Password:** `admin123!`
**Role:** `admin`
**Email:** `karol@ultimasolution.pl`

## Account Lockout Security Feature

### How It Works

The API implements account lockout protection against brute force attacks:

1. **Failed Login Tracking:** Each failed login attempt increments `loginAttempts` counter
2. **Lockout Threshold:** After 5 failed attempts, account is locked
3. **Lock Duration:** Account remains locked for 15 minutes
4. **Automatic Reset:** Successful login resets the counter to 0

### Configuration

From `/src/models/User.ts`:

```typescript
export const USER_VALIDATION = {
  MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS: 5,
  LOCK_TIME: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes in milliseconds
}
```

### Database Schema

```typescript
export interface User {
  loginAttempts?: number // Number of consecutive failed attempts
  lockUntil?: Date // Date/time when account unlocks
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Lock Detection Logic

From `/src/services/UserService.ts`:

```typescript
// Check if account is locked
if (user.lockUntil && new Date(user.lockUntil) > new Date()) {
  const lockTimeRemaining = Math.ceil((new Date(user.lockUntil).getTime() - new Date().getTime()) / (1000 * 60))
  throw new Error(`Account is locked. Try again in ${lockTimeRemaining} minutes.`)
}
```

## Manual Unlock vs. Automatic Unlock

### Manual Unlock (Immediate)

```bash
npm run unlock:admin
```

- **Use when:** Account is locked and you need immediate access
- **Effect:** Resets attempts to 0, removes lock immediately
- **No password change**

### Password Reset (Immediate + New Password)

```bash
npm run reset:admin-password
```

- **Use when:** Password is forgotten or corrupted
- **Effect:** Sets password to `admin123!`, unlocks account, resets attempts
- **Includes verification step**

### Automatic Unlock (Wait)

- **Wait time:** 15 minutes from last failed attempt
- **Effect:** Lock expires automatically, attempts remain
- **No action needed**

## Troubleshooting

### Scenario 1: "Account is locked" Error

**Solution:** Run `npm run unlock:admin`

### Scenario 2: "Invalid credentials" Error (After Unlock)

**Solution:** Run `npm run reset:admin-password`

### Scenario 3: Need to Reset Other User Passwords

**Solution:** Modify `reset-admin-password.ts` to accept username parameter:

```typescript
const username = process.argv[2] || 'admin'
const newPassword = process.argv[3] || 'default123!'
```

Usage:

```bash
npx tsx reset-admin-password.ts carlo carlo123!
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Hashing

```typescript
const SALT_ROUNDS = 12 // bcrypt salt rounds
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(newPassword, SALT_ROUNDS)
```

- **Algorithm:** bcrypt
- **Salt Rounds:** 12 (strong security, ~250ms hash time)
- **Storage:** Hashed password stored in MongoDB
- **Verification:** `bcrypt.compare(plaintext, hash)`

### Account Lockout Protection

- ✅ Prevents brute force attacks
- ✅ Protects against credential stuffing
- ✅ Automatic lock after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ 15-minute lockout period
- ✅ Admin can manually unlock critical accounts

### Best Practices

1. **Never log passwords:** Passwords are never logged in plaintext
2. **Use strong passwords:** Minimum 8 characters recommended
3. **Monitor failed attempts:** Track suspicious login activity
4. **Secure password reset:** Only admins can run reset scripts
5. **Database access control:** Limit who can run these scripts
