npm test                          # Full Jest test suite
npm run test:coverage             # Coverage reports (>80% threshold)
npm run test:watch                # Development watch mode
npm run check:quality             # Complete quality gate
```

### **Angular UI Testing**

```bash
npm test                          # Jest-based Angular tests
npm run test:coverage             # Angular test coverage
npm run build:prod                # Production build verification
