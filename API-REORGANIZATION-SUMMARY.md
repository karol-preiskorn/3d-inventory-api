# API Reorganization by Tags - Summary

## Overview

The 3D Inventory API has been successfully reorganized by grouping endpoints according to their assigned tags. This improves the documentation structure and makes it easier to navigate related endpoints.

## Tag Groups and Endpoints

### 1. **Authentication** (2 endpoints)

- `/login` - User login to obtain JWT token
- `/protected` - Protected route, requires Bearer token

### 2. **Logs** (8 endpoints)

- `/logs` - Main logs operations
- `/logs/attributes/{id}` - Logs for specific attributes
- `/logs/attributesDictionary/{id}` - Logs for attributes dictionary
- `/logs/component/{component}` - Logs filtered by component
- `/logs/connection/{id}` - Logs for specific connections
- `/logs/device/{id}` - Logs for specific devices
- `/logs/model/{id}` - Logs for specific models
- `/logs/{id}` - Logs by ID

### 3. **Devices** (3 endpoints)

- `/devices` - Main devices operations
- `/devices/model/{id}` - Device model operations
- `/devices/{id}` - Individual device operations

### 4. **Models** (2 endpoints)

- `/models` - Main models operations
- `/models/{id}` - Individual model operations

### 5. **Connections** (6 endpoints)

- `/connections` - Main connections operations
- `/connections/devices` - Device connections
- `/connections/from/{idFrom}/to/{idTo}` - Specific route connections
- `/connections/from/{id}` - Connections from specific device
- `/connections/to/{id}` - Connections to specific device
- `/connections/{id}` - Individual connection operations

### 6. **Attributes** (2 endpoints)

- `/attributes` - Main attributes operations
- `/attributes/{id}` - Individual attribute operations

### 7. **Attributes Dictionary** (5 endpoints)

- `/attributesDictionary` - Main attributes dictionary operations
- `/attributesDictionary/connections` - Connection attributes dictionary
- `/attributesDictionary/devices` - Device attributes dictionary
- `/attributesDictionary/models` - Model attributes dictionary
- `/attributesDictionary/{id}` - Individual dictionary entry operations

### 8. **Floors** (2 endpoints)

- `/floors` - Main floors operations
- `/floors/{id}` - Individual floor operations

### 9. **GitHub** (1 endpoint)

- `/github/issues` - GitHub integration for issues

### 10. **Users** (2 endpoints)

- `/users` - Main users operations
- `/users/{id}` - Individual user operations

### 11. **Untagged** (1 endpoint)

- `/health` - Health check endpoint

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Improved Navigation**: Related endpoints are now grouped together, making it easier to find relevant APIs
2. **Logical Structure**: The organization follows the tag hierarchy defined in the OpenAPI specification
3. **Better Documentation**: API documentation tools will now display endpoints in a more logical order
4. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and extend the API as new endpoints can be added to their appropriate tag groups

## Files Modified

- `api.yaml` - Main OpenAPI specification file (reorganized)
- `api.yaml.tag-sorted-backup` - Backup of original organization

## Verification

- All 34 original endpoints are preserved
- Tag assignments remain unchanged
- OpenAPI structure is maintained
- YAML syntax is valid

The API is now organized by tags as requested, with authentication endpoints first, followed by the main functional groups (logs, devices, models, etc.), and utility endpoints at the end.
